This is a simulation for the spreading of an infectinos disease. There are people on a
10 by 10 grid where some are infected and some aren't. Each round, infected people have a
chance to be healed, and healthy people have a chance to be infected from their neighbors,
which are below, above, or next to them. Max number of rounds is 1000, then a final statement
is printed.
