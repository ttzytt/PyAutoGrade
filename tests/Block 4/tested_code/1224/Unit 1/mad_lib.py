Teacher comments:
• This file should not still have reviewer comments in it.
• Variable names must follow proper style. noun_1, not noun1.
• No spaces after function names: "print(", not "print (",
"input(", not "input ("
• Good first try with the comments. See my suggestions below.
• Code should be divided into logical sections using blank lines.

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
