Answer to Questions
Question 1
If the heal possibility is larger than 1.8 times of the infection possibility, the virus will be erdicated.
If the heal possibility is smaller than 1.8 times of the infection possibility, the virus sticks around.

Question 2
Indivuduals closer to the center sick more often, because it's more likely for them to have an infected individual
nearby. Indivuduals closer to the center have 2 to 3 times higher chance to get infected rather than the
individuals at the edges and corners.
