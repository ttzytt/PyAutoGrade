Teacher comments:
• Variable names must follow proper style. name_1, not name1
• Good first try at comments, see my suggestions.
• Good formatting overall.
• No spaces after function names. "input(", not "input ("

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
