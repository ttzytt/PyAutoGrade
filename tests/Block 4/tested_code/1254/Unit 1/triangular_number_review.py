n = int(input('Please enter a number:'))

count = 0

triangular_number = 0

while count < n:
    
    count = count + 1
    triangular_number = triangular_number + count 
    
print("The nth triangle number would be: " + str(triangular_number))


'''R
I feel like saying 'the nth triangular number' isn't very sightly since 'n' was never mentioned
anywhere before this.
I think space between the lines of output would improve readability.
Space after the colon please.
No comment at the top explaining the code.
