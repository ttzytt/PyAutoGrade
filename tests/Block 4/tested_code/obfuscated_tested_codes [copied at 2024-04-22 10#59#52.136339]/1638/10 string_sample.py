"""
The end of a line is denote by the special character '\n'.

Notes:
â€¢ That's a backslash, not a slash. On Mac, it's between 'return' and 'delete'
  (on PC, between 'enter' and 'backspace').
â€¢ Yes, it looks like two characters, but it counts as one.

Some special characters in Python are represented by a backslash (\)
followed by another character. Here are some examples:
    \n    new line character
    \t    tab character  (indents text, though note that in IDLE, hitting
                          the tab key inserts 4 spaces, not a tab character)
    \\    backslash character  (a single \ means the start of a special
                                character, so we need \\ for a regular \)
    \'    single quote  (this can be used to insert the ' in the string
                         'I said "No, it isn\'t!"')
    \"    double quote  (this can be used to insert the "s in the string
                         "I said \"No, it isn't!\"")

Tip: If something isn't working right, make sure you are using \ and not /.
