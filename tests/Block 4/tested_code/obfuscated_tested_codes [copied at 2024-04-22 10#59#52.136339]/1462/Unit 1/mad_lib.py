Teacher comments:
• Variable names must follow proper style.
• Comments go on the line BEFORE the code, not after.
• Comments (the ones above and below) must start with spaces.
• Too many blank lines. They should be used to divide the code into
logical sections.
• Lines of code shouldn't go off the screen.
• Good first try at comments, though they will need to improve
(see my suggestions below).

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
