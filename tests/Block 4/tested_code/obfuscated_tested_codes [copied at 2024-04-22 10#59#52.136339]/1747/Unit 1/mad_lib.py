Teacher comments:
• Good variable names. Though a "phrase" means
part of a sentence – maybe "paragraph" or better yet, "story"
• Ok comments? See my comments in your code.
• Good formatting
• Good story, except the last sentence has some spacing
and grammer issues
• Should have a reviewer listed (even in this file)

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
