Teacher comments:
• File name was "mad_lib .py", should be "mad_lib.py"
• Good variable names
• Reviewer mentioned adding space between words, which is still
needed – the reviewer's comments were a bit vague about where to make
the corrections, but you can always ask them to clarify.
• Comments must start with spaces.
• The output needs spaces in many places

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
