Teacher comments:
• You made changes to the _review file after the review was done.
Please never do this!
• Good variable names.
• You need blank lines in your code for readability.
• Good first try at adding comments, but they will need to improve.
• I wrote an improved version of this program at the end of this file –
use this as an example.

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
