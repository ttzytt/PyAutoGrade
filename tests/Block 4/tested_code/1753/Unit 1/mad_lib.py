Teacher comments:
• This file should not still have reviewer comments in it when you're done.
• Good first attempt at comments, but these will need to get better.
• Good formatting. The only issue is that some lines are still too long
(standard advice is to not go past column 80.)

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
