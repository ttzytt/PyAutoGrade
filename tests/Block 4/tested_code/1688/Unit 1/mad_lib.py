Teacher comments:
• Where is Saanvi's review?? I see a #R in your _review file, but there's no
comment written. Was this deleted, or was the review never completed?
• Good comments. Nice todo comment
• Good variable names
• Good formatting
• No spaces after function names, so "input(" instead of "input (".

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
