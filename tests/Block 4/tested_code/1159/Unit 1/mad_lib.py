Teacher comments:
• This file shouldn't have reviewer comments in it when you're done.
• This is barely a mad lib. It's just one sentence, and doesn't even
use proper punctuation.
• Needs comments!!!

If I make comments in your code,
I will use ### to make them stand out.

Do not remove any of my comments.
